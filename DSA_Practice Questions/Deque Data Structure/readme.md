### Variations Of Queue:-

- Insertions Restricted: -


- Deletion Restricted: -


## Deque :-
- Deque is another variation of Queue.
- Deque is a `Double-Ended Queue`.
- Deque is a linear Data Structure.
- **Both Ends can be used for insertions and deletions.**
- Some Deque may support random access depending on implementation.
- Deque means **Double Ended Queue.**


### Operation On Deque: -
1. insert-front
2. insert-rear
3. delete-front
4. delete-rear
5. get_front
6. get_rear
7. is_empty

### Implementation Of Deque:-
1. Using List
2. By extending list class
3. Using doubly linked list class
4. By extending doubly linked list class
5. Using Linked List concept.
