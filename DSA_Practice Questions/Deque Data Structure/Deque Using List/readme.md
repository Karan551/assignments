# Basic Practice Problems On Deque: -

- **Deque Implementation Using List :-**
1. Define a class `Deque` to implement Deque data structure using a list. Define `__init__()` method to create an empty 
   list object as instance member of Deque.
2. Define a method `is_empty()` to check if the Deque is empty in Deque class.
3. In Deque class define `insert_front()` method to add data at the front end of Deque.
4. In Deque class define `insert_rear()` method to add data at the rear end of the deque.
5. In Deque class define `delete_front()` method to remove front element from the deque.
6. In Deque class, define delete_rear() method to remove a rear element from the deque.
7. In Deque class define `get_front()` method to return a front element of the Deque.
8. In Deque class define `get_rear()` method to return a rear element of the deque.
9. In Deque class define `size()` method return size of the Deque that is number of items present in the Deque.
