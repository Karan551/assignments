## Deque Using Doubly Linked List: -

1. Define a `class Node` with instance object member variable `prev` `item` and `next`.
2. Define a class Deque to implement Deque data structure using Doubly Linked List concept. Define `__init__()`
   method to initialize `front` and `rear` reference variable and `item_count `variable to keep data track of number of
   elements in the Deque.
3. Define a method `is_empty()` to check if the Deque is empty in Deque class.
4. In Deque class define `insert_front()` method to add data in the front of Deque.
5. In Deque class define `insert_rear()` method to add data in the `rear` of Deque.
6. In Deque class define `delete_front()` method to remove from an element of the Deque.
7. In Deque class define `delete_rear()` method to remove a rear element from the Deque.
8. In Deque class define `get_front()` method to return front element from the Deque.
9. In Deque class define `get_rear()` to return rear element from the Deque.
10. In Deque class define `size()` method to return size of the deque that is number of items present in the deque.
