# Queue Using SLL Concept :-



### Basic Practice Problems: -

1. Define a class Queue to implement queue data structure using Singly Linked List concept.Define `__init__()` 
   method to initialize front and rear reference variable and `item_count` variable to keep track of number of 
   elements in the Queue.
2. Define a method `is_empty()` to check if the queue is empty in Queue class. 
3. In Queue class define `enqueue()` method to add data into the queue.
4. In Queue class define `dequeue()` method to remove front element from the queue.
5. In Queue class define `get_front()` method to return rear element of the queue.
6. In Queue class define `get_rear()` method to return rear element of the queue.
7. In Queue class, define `size()` method to return the size of the queue that is number of items present in the queue.
