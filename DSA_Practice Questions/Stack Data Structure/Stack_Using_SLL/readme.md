- **Practice Problems On Stack:** -

1. `Import` module Singly Linked List code your python file.
2. Define a class Stack to implement Stack data structure by `inheriting` SLL class.
3. Define a method `is_empty()` to check if the stack is empty in the Stack class.
4. In Stack class define `push()` method to add data on to Stack.
5. In Stack class define `pop()` method to remove a top element from Stack.
6. In Stack class define `peek()` method to return a top element from Stack.
7. In Stack class define `size()` method that is number of items present in the Stack.
