## Stack Data Structure Using List :-

---
- Practice Problems On Stack: -

1. Define a class Stack to implement Stack Data Structure using List. Define `__init__()` method to create an empty 
   instance object.
2. Define a method `is_empty()` to check the stack is empty in Stack class.
3. In Stack class define `push()` method to add data on to the Stack.
4. In Stack class define a `pop()` method to remove a top element (last element) from the stack.
5. In stack class define a `peek()` method to return a top element on the stack.
6. In Stack class define `size()` method to `return the size of the stack` that is the number of items present in the stack.
