# <p align="center">Stack Using Linked List (Inherit) :-</p>

- **Practice Problems On Stack:** -

1. `Import` module containing Singly Linked List code in your Python file.
2.  Define a class `Stack to implement Stack Data Structure`.Define `__init__()`  method to create a Singly Linked List 
    object.
3.  Define a  method `is_empty()` to check if the Stack is empty in Stack class.
4. In Stack class define `push()` method to add data on to the Stack.
5. In Stack class define `pop()` method to remove a top element from the Stack.
6. In Stack class define `peek()` method to return a top element from the Stack.
7. In Stack class define `size()` method to return the size of the Stack that is the number of items present in the Stack.


> **__Note:__** In Stack we will not insert Node at last we can also add Node at the last Node but If Insert at last 
> then Stack is less optimize instead of We insert Node at the start because we `insert` Node at the `start`, so we will 
> `delete` Node also `start` this way we can more optimize our Stack class.

> __Note:__ If we insert data at the start then we will have to delete Node at the start to remain the concept fo 
> `FILO` or `LIFO`.
