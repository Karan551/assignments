# <p align="center">Stack Using Linked List :-</p>

- **Practice Problems On Stack:** -

1.  Define a class `Stack` to implement stack data structure using `Singly Linkd List` concept. Define `__init__()` 
   method to initialize `start` reference variable and `item_count` variable to keep track of number of elements in the 
   Stack.
2. Define a method `is_empty()` to check if the stack is empty in Stack class.
3.  In Stack class define `push()`method to add data on the stack.
4.  In Stack class define `pop()` method to remove a top element from the stack.
5. In Stack class define `peek()` method to return a top element on the stack.
6.  In Stack class define `size()` method to return the size of the stack that is number of items present in the stack.
