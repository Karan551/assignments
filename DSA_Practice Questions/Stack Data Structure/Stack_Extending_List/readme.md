## Stack Extending List :-

____
**Practice Problems On Stack: -**

1. Define a `class Stack` to implement Stack Data Structure by `extending a list`.
2. Define a method `is_empty()` to check stack is empty in Stack class.
3. In Stack class define `push()` method to add data on the stack.
4. In Stack class define `pop()` method to remove a top element from the Stack.
5. In Stack class define `size()` method to return the size of the Stack that is number of items present in the Stack.
6. Implement a way to restrict use of `insert()` method of list class from a stack object.
7. Implement a way to `restrict use of an iterable` stack an object.
