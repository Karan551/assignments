# Regex Notes :-
- A Regular expression or **Regex** is a special sequence of characters that used to search pattern to find a string 
  or set of strings.
- Python has a built-in module named `re` that is used for **regular expression in Python**.

## raw string :- 
- **raw string** is slightly **different** from **regular string** it won't interpret \ characters as an escape 
  character. This 
  is because regular expression engine uses \ character for its own escaping purpose.

## Meta Characters :-

1. #### &nbsp; \ Backslash: -
      Backslash character (\) makes sure that character is not treated in a special way. This can be considered a 
   way of escaping metacharacters.
