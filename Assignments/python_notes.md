# Python :-

- Python is a high level general purpose programming language. It's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with
  the use of significant indentation.
- **Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.** It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
  structured (particularly procedural), **object-oriented** and **functional programming**. It is often described as a
  **"batteries included"** language due to its comprehensive standard library.

## History Of Python :-

- Python was conceived in the late 1980s by **[Guido Van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum)** at
  **Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica** in the Netherlands as a successor of the **ABC Language**.
- He has been in variably worked as the lead developer until 12 July 2018.
- In January 2019 active Python core developer elected a five member council to lead the Project.

------

### ðŸŒŸ Variable :-

- Variable are used to hold data during execution of the programme.
- In C , C++ you need to declare variables only after declaration you can use them.
- Example :-
  ```text
  int a;
  float b;
  ```
- In Python, you do not declare variable. If there is a need of a variable you think of a name nd start using it is a
  variable.

#### ðŸŒŸ Variable Name :-

- **Variable name is any combination of alphabet,digit and underscore.**
- **Variable name can not start with digit.**
- **Variable name are case-sensitive.**
- **Keywords can not be uses as variable names.**
- **Variable can be deleted also using** `del` **keyword.**

#### ðŸŒŸ Dynamic Type :-

- Not only the value of a variable may change during programme execution but type as well.
    - For example :- ðŸ‘‡

      ```python
      marks = 5                   # type of x is int.
      salary = 50000.725          # type of x is float.
      isNumber = True             # type of x is bool.
      user_name = "Iron Man"      # type of x is str.
      ```
- All Data types are class in Python.

#### ðŸŒŸ Data Types :-

1. Numbers :-
   --- Here display table
2. Boolean
3. String

- `double` is no there in Python.
- `char`  is not there in Python.
- _----- Here show picture.

#### ðŸŒŸ Name kiska hota hai:-

- Name in namespace is a variable which is used to contain id(reference) of
    1. Instance object
    2. Function object
    3. Class object

    - ðŸŒŸ  **&nbsp; In Python everything is object.**

### ðŸŒŸ What is an object :-

- Object is something which can store data and has methods(function) to handle data.
- **e.g. :-** ðŸ‘‡
  ```python
  a, b, c = 5, 6, 7
  print(a, b, c, sep="-", end="$")
  print("Hello")
  # <<< 5-6-7$Hello
  ```

-----

### Data :-

- Data is any piece of information which is used by the programme to accomplish(complete) a task.
- **e.g. :-** ðŸ‘‡

    1. Find sum of two numbers.
    2. check whether a given number is even or odd.
    3. Find LCM of two numbers.

- All the above tasks can be done only using some data.

#### ðŸŒŸ Variety of Data :-

1. Integers
2. Real (Float)
3. Strings

#### ðŸŒŸ Garbage Collection :-

- It is a programme invoked(called) by Python itself whenever required whose job is to release memory of Garbage
  blocks.(Object which is not referenced by any name/variable.)

#### ðŸŒŸ What is an Object :-

- Object is real entity.
- Object is an instance of a class.
- Object is a proper noun.
- Class is a common noun.
- **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

    - Doctor ----> Common Noun (class)
    - Dr. Mak ----> Proper Noun (object)
    - Dr. Alok ----> Proper Noun (object)

#### ðŸŒŸ `print()` function :-

**Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)
```

- print simple text ---->  `print("Welcome")`
- print variable ----> `print(x)`
- print expression ----> `print(x + 5*3)`
- print multiple value ----> `print(x , y)`

-----

### ðŸŒŸ Module Package & Library :-

- **Module :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **It is a Python file. It can contain instance objects , function objects and class objects. In
  Simple words it contains variables functions and classes.**
    - **`.py` file is known as Module.**
- **Package :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **Package is a collection of module and sub-packages.**
- **Library :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **Library is a collection of packages.**

-----

### ðŸŒŸ `import` :-

  ```text
  import moduleName
  
  moduleName.moduleElement
  ```

- **Module element can be :- ðŸ‘‡**
    - `variable`
    - `function`
    - `class`
- If we want to import specific object form any module then we will write
  ```python
  from A2 import  x
  ```
- Where :-
    - A2 ðŸ‘‰ **Module Name**
    - x ðŸ‘‰  **module element**

### ðŸŒŸ Keywords :-

- Predefined words
- Reserved words
- There are 35 keywords in `Python` .

|        |          |           |        |
|:------:|:--------:|:---------:|:------:|
| False  |  class   |   from    |   or   |
|  True  | continue |  global   |  pass  |
|  None  |   def    |    if     | raise  |
|  and   |   del    |  import   | return |
|   as   |   elif   |    in     |  try   |
| assert |   else   |    is     | while  |
| async  |  except  |  lambda   |  with  |
| await  | finally  | non local | yield  |
| break  |   for    |    not    |        |

1. `int()`
2. `float()`
3. `complex()`
4. `bool()`
5. `str()`

### ðŸŒŸ Number System :-

1. **Binary Number System :-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp;0 , 1**
2. **Octal Number System :-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp;0 , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7**
3. **Decimal Number System :-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp;0 , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,**
4. **Hexa Decimal Number System :-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp;0 , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F**

### ðŸŒŸ Number Conversion :-

```python
x = 25
bin(x)
# <<<< '0b11001'
oct(x)
# <<<< '0o31'
hex(x)
# <<<< '0x19'

#  x = 0b11001 (in binary)
#  x = 0o31    (in octal)
#  x = 0x19    (in hexadecimal)
```

### ðŸŒŸ Unicode :-

- **The Unicode is character encoding and its goal is to replace like existing character sets with its standard UTF.**

    - UTF ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; Unicode Transformation Format**
    - UTF-8 ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; It is the most commonly used character encoding. It is also backward compatible with ASCII.**

### ðŸŒŸ Character To Unicode :-

```python
x = "A"
ord(x)
# <<<< 65
```

### ðŸŒŸ Unicode To Character  :-

```python
x = 65
chr(x)
# <<<< 'A'
```

### ðŸŒŸ Taking input from the User `input()`:-

- `input()` can take at most one argument of `str` type.
- `input()` always return `str` type value.
