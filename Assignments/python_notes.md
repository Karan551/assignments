# Python <span id="python-intro"></span> :-

- Python is a high level general purpose programming language. It's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with
  the use of significant indentation.
- **Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.** It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
  structured (particularly procedural), **object-oriented** and **functional programming**. It is often described as a
  **"batteries included"** language due to its comprehensive standard library.

## History Of Python :-

- Python was conceived in the late 1980s by **[Guido Van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum)** at
  **Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica** in the Netherlands as a successor of the **ABC Language**.
- He has been in variably worked as the lead developer until 12 July 2018.
- In January 2019 active Python core developer elected a five member council to lead the Project.

------

### ðŸŒŸ Variable :-

- Variable are used to hold data during execution of the programme.
- In C , C++ you need to declare variables only after declaration you can use them.
- Example :-
  ```text
  int a;
  float b;
  ```
- In Python, you do not declare variable. If there is a need of a variable you think of a name nd start using it is a
  variable.

#### ðŸŒŸ Variable Name :-

- **Variable name is any combination of alphabet,digit and underscore.**
- **Variable name can not start with digit.**
- **Variable name are case-sensitive.**
- **Keywords can not be uses as variable names.**
- **Variable can be deleted also using** `del` **keyword.**

#### ðŸŒŸ Dynamic Type :-

- Not only the value of a variable may change during programme execution but type as well.
    - For example :- ðŸ‘‡

      ```python
      marks = 5                   # type of x is int.
      salary = 50000.725          # type of x is float.
      isNumber = True             # type of x is bool.
      user_name = "Iron Man"      # type of x is str.
      ```
- All Data types are class in Python.

#### ðŸŒŸ Data Types :-

1. Numbers :-
   --- Here display table
2. Boolean
3. String

- `double` is no there in Python.
- `char`  is not there in Python.
- _----- Here show picture.

#### ðŸŒŸ Name kiska hota hai:-

- Name in namespace is a variable which is used to contain id(reference) of
    1. Instance object
    2. Function object
    3. Class object

    - ðŸŒŸ  **&nbsp; In Python everything is object.**

### ðŸŒŸ What is an object :-

- Object is something which can store data and has methods(function) to handle data.
- **e.g. :-** ðŸ‘‡
  ```python
  a, b, c = 5, 6, 7
  print(a, b, c, sep="-", end="$")
  print("Hello")
  # <<< 5-6-7$Hello
  ```

-----

### Data :-

- Data is any piece of information which is used by the programme to accomplish(complete) a task.
- **e.g. :-** ðŸ‘‡

    1. Find sum of two numbers.
    2. check whether a given number is even or odd.
    3. Find LCM of two numbers.

- All the above tasks can be done only using some data.

#### ðŸŒŸ Variety of Data :-

1. Integers
2. Real (Float)
3. Strings

#### ðŸŒŸ Garbage Collection :-

- It is a programme invoked(called) by Python itself whenever required whose job is to release memory of Garbage
  blocks.(Object which is not referenced by any name/variable.)

#### ðŸŒŸ What is an Object :-

- Object is real entity.
- Object is an instance of a class.
- Object is a proper noun.
- Class is a common noun.
- **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

    - Doctor ----> Common Noun (class)
    - Dr. Mak ----> Proper Noun (object)
    - Dr. Alok ----> Proper Noun (object)

#### ðŸŒŸ `print()` function :-

**Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)
```

- print simple text ---->  `print("Welcome")`
- print variable ----> `print(x)`
- print expression ----> `print(x + 5*3)`
- print multiple value ----> `print(x , y)`

-----

### ðŸŒŸ Module Package & Library :-

- **Module :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **It is a Python file. It can contain instance objects , function objects and class objects. In
  Simple words it contains variables functions and classes.**
    - **`.py` file is known as Module.**
- **Package :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **Package is a collection of module and sub-packages.**
- **Library :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **Library is a collection of packages.**

-----

### ðŸŒŸ `import` :-

  ```text
  import moduleName
  
  moduleName.moduleElement
  ```

- **Module element can be :- ðŸ‘‡**
    - `variable`
    - `function`
    - `class`
- If we want to import specific object form any module then we will write
  ```python
  from A2 import  x
  ```
- Where :-
    - A2 ðŸ‘‰ **Module Name**
    - x ðŸ‘‰  **module element**

### ðŸŒŸ Keywords <span id="keywords"></span> :-

- Predefined words
- Reserved words
- There are 35 keywords in `Python` .

|        |          |           |        |
|:------:|:--------:|:---------:|:------:|
| False  |  class   |   from    |   or   |
|  True  | continue |  global   |  pass  |
|  None  |   def    |    if     | raise  |
|  and   |   del    |  import   | return |
|   as   |   elif   |    in     |  try   |
| assert |   else   |    is     | while  |
| async  |  except  |  lambda   |  with  |

2. **Octal Number System :-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp;0 , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7**
3. **Decimal Number System :-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp;0 , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,**
4. **Hexa Decimal Number System :-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp;0 , 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F**

### ðŸŒŸ Number Conversion :-

```python
x = 25
bin(x)
# <<<< '0b11001'
oct(x)
# <<<< '0o31'
hex(x)
# <<<< '0x19'

#  x = 0b11001 (in binary)
#  x = 0o31    (in octal)
#  x = 0x19    (in hexadecimal)
```

### ðŸŒŸ Unicode :-

- **The Unicode is character encoding and its goal is to replace like existing character sets with its standard UTF.**

    - UTF ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; Unicode Transformation Format**
    - UTF-8 ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; It is the most commonly used character encoding. It is also backward compatible with ASCII.**

### ðŸŒŸ Character To Unicode :-

```python
x = "A"
ord(x)
# <<<< 65
```

### ðŸŒŸ Unicode To Character  :-

```python
x = 65
chr(x)
# <<<< 'A'
```

### ðŸŒŸ Taking input from the User `input()`:-

- `input()` can take at most one argument of `str` type.
- `input()` always return `str` type value.

-----

### ðŸŒŸ Operators :-

----- 

## ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ List <span id="list"></span> :-

- **`list` is a class.**
- **`list` is an iterable sequence.**
- **`list` is growable.**
- **`list` can store heterogeneous data.**
- **`list` elements are indexed.**
- ***List* is one fo the most commonly used sequences, and it is a most flexible type basically a list can contain any
  type (string, float, integer etc.) and number of items. It can hold one data type or a combination of several data
  types .**
- **A List is mutable(changeable) hence you can add, delete modify elements. We can build a list by assigning to it
  using the following syntax :-**
- **Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‡
  ```text
  lst_items = [ item1, item2, item3,.......]
  ```

**Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
lst = [0, 5, 10, "Hello", "Python"]
```

### How to create list object :-

```python
# Square brackets are used to denote a list.
l1 = [10, 20, 30]

# Empty list object
l2 = []

# Heterogeneous elements
l3 = [50, 35, "abc", "Python", "JavaScript"]
```

### ðŸŒŸ How to access list elements :-

```python
l1 = [50, 20, 80, 30, 60, 40]
print(l1)
# <<< [50, 20, 80, 30, 60, 40]

print(l1[0])
# <<< 50

print(l1[1], l1[2])
# <<< 20 80

# Create a list of first 4 numbers
num_list = list(range(4))
print(num_list)
# <<< [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

- I have to insert Here image of list indexing

#### ðŸŒŸ Indexing :-

- **Just like strings we can access items on a list with the `index operator[]`.**
- **Always use an integer when indexing to avoid `TypeError`. Attempting to access a list element that is beyond the
  index range will result to and `IndexError.`**

##### ðŸŒŸ **Nested Indexing :-**

  ```python
lst_elements = [5, 6, 10, 15, "code", [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]]
print(lst_elements[5][1])
# <<< 3
print(lst_elements[4][0])
# <<< c
   ```

###### ðŸŒŸ **Negative Indexing :-**

- The last item on the list takes the -1 index the second to the last has the -2 index and so on.

```python
num_lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
print(num_lst[-1])  # same as it is ---> print(num_lst[len(num_lst)-1]) 
# <<< 80
print(num_lst[-2])  # same as it is ---> print(num_lst[len(num_lst)-2]) 
# <<< 70
```

##### ðŸŒŸ **Slicing of List :-**

- The slicing operator the `colon(:)` is used to access a range of elements on lists.

- **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
char_list = ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o", "W", "o", "r", "l", "d"]
print(char_list[0:5])
# ["H","e","l","l","o"]
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Accessing list elements via `for` loop :-

```python
num_lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]

for num in num_lst:
    print(num, end=" ")
```

##### ðŸŒŸ Accessing list elements via `while` loop :-

```python
num_lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]

i = 0
while i < len(num_lst):
    print(num_lst[i], end="")
    i += 1
```

##### ðŸŒŸ How to delete an element from the list:-

```python
num_lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
del num_lst[4]
```

##### ðŸŒŸ How to edit an element of the list:-

```python
num_lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
num_lst[4] = 100

# <<< [10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 60, 70, 80]
```

#### How to add more elements in the list :-

```python
num_lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
num_lst[6] = 60  # Index error

# not adding more values in the list but only updating values at index 3 & 1
num_lst[3] = 800
num_lst[1] = 600
```

- There are the following methods to add elements in the list:-

1. `append()`
2. `extend()`
3. `insert()`

- `class` is a group of variables and functions. These variables and functions are called attributes.

##### ðŸŒŸ Syntax :- ðŸ‘‡

```text
listObject.append(value)

listObject.extend(iterable)

listObject.insert(index,value)
```

- `append()` method adds value at the end of the list that is new element will become the last element of the list.
- `extend()` method extends the list by appending all the items from the iterable.
    - `extend()` method takes exactly one argument(maximum) and that argument should be iterable.
    - `extend()` method append(add) only iterable value not iterable type.
- `insert(index,value)` method insert an item at a given position.
    - if `index > last_index` then value will store at `last_index +1` means value will be appended.

#### ðŸŒŸ Example :- ðŸ‘‡

```python
num_lst = [10, 20, 30]

num_lst.append(40)
print(num_lst)
# <<< [10,20,30,40]

num_lst.insert(1, 200)
print(num_lst)
# <<< [10,200,30,40]

# if index > last_index then 
num_lst.insert(10, 10000)
print(num_lst)
# <<< [10,20,30,40,1000]

num_lst.extend([60, 70, 80, 90])
print(num_lst)
# <<<< [10,20,30,40,1000,60,70,80,90]

lst = [1, 3, 5]
lst.extend(range(6))

# this will give error because extend takes exactly one argument here two is given
# lst.extend([1,2,4,5],[7,8,9])  
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Packing And Unpacking :-

```python
a, b, c = 10, 20, 30
lst = [a, b, c]  # packing

num_lst = [40, 50, 60]
a, b, c = num_lst  # unpacking
```

- ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ **When we unpack of any sequence then, number of variables on the left hand side must be same as the number of
  elements in the list.**
- ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ **If we don't know how many elements are there in the `list/tuple/set` then we will have to assign at least one
  variable and after this variable we will have to use asterisk sign and name of the variable.**

```python
lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
a, *b = lst

print(a)
# <<< 10
print(b)  # type of b is list 
# <<< [20,30,40,50,60,70]
```

### ðŸŒŸ Built-in methods :-

1. `len()` ðŸ‘‰ Returns length of specified iterable.
2. `min()` ðŸ‘‰ Returns minimum value element.
3. `max()` ðŸ‘‰ Returns maximum value element.
4. `sum()` ðŸ‘‰ Returns sum of elements.
5. `sorted()` ðŸ‘‰ Returns sorted new list of elements (it's not change original list).

#### ðŸŒŸ `list()` method :-

- `list()` method takes at most(maximum) one argument that argument should be iterable.

```python
# create an empty list object.
lst = list()

# this will gives error because int object is not iterable.
# lst1=list(10)  

# this will gives error because list() method takes maximum one argument here 3 is given.
# lst2=list(10,20,30)

lst3 = list("Captain America")
# <<< ['C', 'a', 'p', 't', 'a', 'i', 'n', ' ', 'A', 'm', 'e', 'r', 'i', 'c', 'a']

lst4 = list(range(5))
# <<< [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

lst5 = list([10, 20])
# <<< [10,20]
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Comparison Operator on `list` :-

```python
l1 = [1, 2, 3]
l2 = [2, 3, 1]
l3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
l4 = [1, 2, 3]
```

- If we compare two `list` then give the following results :-
- `l1 == l2` ðŸ‘‰ `False`
- `l1 == l3` ðŸ‘‰ `False`
- `l1 == l4` ðŸ‘‰ `True`
- `l1 > l4`  ðŸ‘‰ `True`

#### ðŸŒŸ Concatenation Operator :-

```python
lst1 = [1, 5, 9]
lst2 = [2, 3, 1]

result = lst1 + lst2

print(result)
# <<< [1, 5, 9, 2, 3, 1]
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Repetition Operator :-

```python
l1 = [2, 5]
print(l1 * 5)
# <<< [2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5]
```

#### ðŸŒŸ list of lists :-

```python
lst = [[1, 3, 5], [2, 1, 8], [5, 4, 4]]
```

#### ðŸŒŸ `list` object methods :-

<p align="center"> ðŸŒŸ <strong>Adding elements to a list :-</strong></p>

1. `append()` :- ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **It is used to add a single item at the end of the original list. It works with element data
   type not a value. It is change the original `list` object.**
    ```text
    list_object.append(object)
    ```
2. `extend()` :- ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **It is used to add two or more items at the end of the original list. It works only on
   element value not data type.**
    ```text
    list_object.extend(iterable)
    ```
3. `insert()` :- This method is used to insert an item on your desired location.
    ```text
    list_object.insert(index_number, value)
    ```

- **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
even_number = [2, 4, 6, 8]
even_number.append(10)
print(even_number)
# <<< [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

num_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
num_list.extend([101, 501, 511])
print(num_list)
# <<< [10, 20, 30, 40, 101, 501, 511]

odd_number = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
odd_number.insert(2, 55)
print(odd_number)
# <<< [1, 3, 55, 7, 9]
```

<p align="center"> ðŸŒŸ <strong>Removing or Deleting elements from a list :-</strong></p>

- There are four methods to remove items from the list :-

1. **`remove()` :-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; To remove an item from a list we can use remove method. It does not return anything.**
    ```text
    list_object.remove(value)
    ```

2. `pop()` :- ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; It is used to remove the item associated with the given index. If the index is not given By
   default It removes last element and returns that element. It is returned that value that is removed from the `list`.
   **
    ```text
    list_object.pop(index_value)
    ```
3. `clear()` :- **It is used to create an empty `list`.**
    ```text
    list_object.clear()
    ```
4. `del` **keyword :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; It is used to delete one or more items or event the entire list.
    - **To delete one item from the list is , Syntax is :-** <br />
      ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; `del list_object[index_value]`
    - **To delete range of item from the list is , Syntax is :-** <br />
      ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; `del list_object[:]`
    - **We can delete the entire items from the list by the replacing the entire range of items with an empty space.**
        - **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
numbers_list[:] = []
print(numbers_list)
# <<< []
``` 

#### ðŸŒŸ Example :-

```python
numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, "Hello", 7]
numbers_list.remove("Hello")
print(numbers_list)
# <<< [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

color_list = ["red", "yellow", "blue", "green", "pink", "brown", "white"]

# It removes the third index element from the list.
color_list.pop(3)

# It removes last item (By default).
color_list.pop()

color_list.clear()
print(color_list)
# <<< []
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Sorting Items on a `list` :-

- `sort()` **:-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **This method is used to sort items of similar data type with in the list. It sorts the items
  in ascending order (By default). It changes original `list`.**
- **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
number_list = [15, 13, 12, 16, 11, 14]
number_list.sort()
print(number_list)
# <<< [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Reverse method :-

- **This method is used to arrange items in the reverse or descending order. It changes original `list` also.**
- **Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‡

```text
list_object.sort(key=None, reverse=False)
```

- **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
number_list = [15, 13, 12, 16, 11, 14]
# sort in ascending order (By default)
number_list.reverse()
print(number_list)
# <<< [16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11]

# sort in descending order
number_list.sort(reverse=True)
```

#### ðŸŒŸ `count()` method :-

- The `count()` method counts how many times an object occurs in a list.
    ```text
    list_object.count(object)
    ```

#### ðŸŒŸ `index()` method :-

- `index()` method returns of first occurrence of specifies element.

### ðŸŒŸ Some other important method of list :-

1. `copy()` :- ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **This method returns a shallow copy of the list.**
2.

#### ðŸŒŸ Testing For Membership in the `list` :-

- **Membership operators are used to test if an object is stored in a list. It returns True Oor False after evaluating
  the
  expression.**

```python
numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(9 in numbers_list)
# <<< True

print(15 not in numbers_list)
## True
```

### ðŸŒŸ `list` Comprehension :-

- **`list` comprehension is a concise way of creating new list from an existing list. It consists of a expression and a
  `for` loop enclose in square brackets.**

**Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‡

```text
[expression for variable in iterable ]
```

```python
# Creating a list of 100 numbers using list comprehension :-
number_list = [number for number in range(1, 101)]

# for even number using filter
even_number_list = [number for number in range(1, 101) if number % 2 == 0]

# without list comprehension

lst = []
for num in range(1, 101):
    lst.append(num)
```

#### ðŸŒŸ `sorted(iterable, key=function_name, reverse=False)` :-

- **Returns a new list containing all items from the iterable in ascending order.**
- **A custom key function can be supplied to customize sort order.**
- **By default, it sorted in ascending order if we want to sort in descending order then we will have to
  set `reverse = True`**
- **By default `reverse = False`.**

-----

### ðŸŒŸ Mutability and Hashability :-

- **Mutable objects are changeable.**
- **immutable objects are not changeable.**
- **All immutable objects are hashable but not all hashable objects are immutable.**
- **Hashable is a feature of Python objects that tells if the object has a hash value or not if it has a hash value that
  does not change during its entire lifetime.**

| Data Type | Hashable | Mutable |
|:---------:|:--------:|:-------:|
|   `int`   |   Yes    |   No    |
|  `float`  |   Yes    |   No    |
| `complex` |   Yes    |   No    |
|  `bool`   |   Yes    |   No    |
|   `str`   |   Yes    |   No    |
|   `str`   |   Yes    |   No    |
|  `range`  |   Yes    |   No    |
|  `list`   |    No    |   Yes   |
|  `tuple`  |   Yes    |   No    |
|   `set`   |    No    |   Yes   |
|  `dict`   |    No    |   Yes   |

<h2 align="center" id="tuple">ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ Tuple</h2>

- `tuple` is a class.
- `tuple` is iterable.
- `tuple` is immutable.
- `tuple` is hashable.
- `tuple` is a sequence.
- A `tuple` is a sequence data type that contains ordered collectoin of objects. It is a immutable data type so once you
  have created we can not delete and update its elements.
- It is faster than list because we can delete or update its elements.

### ðŸŒŸ How To Create `tuple` object :-

- **To create a `tuple` we can place the elements with in parentheses and separate them with a comma.**
- We cannot create a tuple ony one element if we do this then we have to place a comma after the element.

```python
t1 = (10, 20, 30, 40)
t2 = ()  # empty value
# t3 = (10)  # It is not a tuple.
t4 = (10,)  # It is a tuple.
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Accessing `tuple` elements :-

##### Indexing :-

- The index operator indicates the index of the element that you want to access.

##### Slicing :-

- **If we want to access several items at the same time then we will have to use the slicing operator.**

- **We can access tuple elements using loop(while or for).**

- **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
tp = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)

# via indexing access tuple elements :-
print(tp[2])
# <<< 30

# via slicing access tuple elements 
print(tp[3:5])
# << (40, 50)

# ----------------------- using  while loop

count = 0
while count < len(tp):
    print(tp[count], end="")
    count += 1

# ----------------------- using  for loop
for item in tp:
    print(item, end="")
```

#### Concatenation and Repetition Operator :-

```python
tp1 = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)
tp2 = (11, 21, 31, 41)

print(tp1 + tp2)
# <<< (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 11, 21, 31, 41)

print(tp2 + tp1)
# <<< (11, 21, 31, 41, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)

print(tp2 * 3)
# <<< (11, 21, 31, 41, 11, 21, 31, 41, 11, 21, 31, 41)
```

#### Comparison Operator :-

```python
tp1 = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60)
tp2 = (11, 21, 31, 41)

print(tp1 > tp2)
# False

print(tp2 < tp1)
# True

print(tp1 == tp2)
## <<< False
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Changing Reassigning and Deleting `tuple` elements :-

- **A `tuple` is immutable(unchangeable) data type so we cannot alter its elements.**
- **To reassign a `tuple` we an just list a different set of elements and assigning it to the `tuple`.**

- To delete a tuple and all the items you will use the keyword `del`.
- **Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‰   `del tuple_name`

### `tuple` object methods :-

- Only two python methods works with tuples.
    1. `count()`:- ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; It returns the number of elements which is equal to the given elements.**
        - **Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‰ `tuple_object.count(element)`
    2. `index()` :- ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; It returns the index of the first element which is equal to the given element.**
        - **Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‰ `tuple_object.index(element)`

```python
tp1 = (10, 20, 30, 10, 50, 20, 10, 20, 10, 20, 10)
print(tp1.count(20))
# <<< 4
print(tp1.index(30))
# <<< 2
```

### ðŸŒŸ User input :-

```python
user_input = input("enter numbers comma separated : ")

user_tuple = [number for number in user_input.split(",")]

# other way to create a tuple 
t2 = tuple()

t3 = tuple([10, 20, 30, 50, 40, 60, 90, 80, 70])
# <<< (10, 20, 30, 50, 40, 60, 90, 80, 70)

t4 = tuple(range(5))
# <<< (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
```

### ðŸŒŸ built-in-methods :-

1. `len()`
2. `min()`
3. `max()`
4. `sum()`
5. `sorted()`

<h2 align="center" id="set"> ðŸŒŸ Set :- </h2>

- `set` is class.
- `set` is mutable.
- `set` is not hashable.
- `set` is not a sequence.
- `set` can not have duplicate values.
- `set` does not guarantee to store values in the order of insertion.
- Indexing is not applicable to set object.
- Slicing operator is not applicable.
- **A `set` is an ordered group of unique elements. Although a set itself is mutable its elements must be immutable.**
- A `set` is a collection unordered and unindexed that is iterable mutable and has no duplicate elements.

### ðŸŒŸ How to create a `set` object :-

- **We can create a `set` by enclosing all elements in curly braces or by using `set()` constructor.**
- **A `set` can hold items of different data type such as float, tuple string or integer.**
- **It cannot hold a mutable element such as a `dictionary`, `list` or `set`.**
- A comma is used to separate items from each other.

```python
s1 = {1, 5, 8}
s2 = {10, 2, 5, 14, 2, 8, 2, 8}

s3 = {}  # not a set object.

# To create a empty set object.
s4 = set()

```

- **To create an empty `set` we will have to use the `set()` function without an argument. We cannot use empty curly
  braces
  as this is the syntax for creating an empty dictionary.**

### ðŸŒŸ Accessing `set` elements :-

```python
# via for loop 

for e in setObject:
    print(e, end="")
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Concatenation and Repetition Operator :-

```text
# Concatenation operator
set + set ---> not supported    

# Repetition operator
set * int ---> not supported
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Comparison Operator :-

```text
s1 > s2
s1 < s2

s1 >= s2
s1 <= s2
s1 == s2
s1 != s2
```

- **Tow set objects are equal if their element are same doesn't matter the order of elements.**

#### ðŸŒŸ Changing elements in a `set` :-

- **Sets are mutable so we can change their elements. Because sets are unordered you cannot access or change an item or
  items through indexing or slicing.**

1. `add()` :- **This method is used to append a single element to a `set`.**
2. `update()` :- **This method is used to add multiple elements to a set. Strings, lists tuples or other set can be used
   as argument when we use `update()` method.**
    - **This method only element value not a data type.**

```python
my_set = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
my_set.add(12)
print(my_set)
# <<< {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12}

my_set.update([7, 9, 11, 13])
print(my_set)
# <<< {2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13}
```

### ðŸŒŸ Removing `set` elements :-

- There are two methods to remove a specific item from a set.

1. `remove()` **:-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; This method is used to remove an item to a set. It `raise error` when the given argument
   does not exist.**
2. `discard()` **:-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; It is used to remove an item from a set. It does not raise error when the given
   argument does not exist. It simply remains unchanged to set.**
3. `pop()` **:-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp;This method is used to remove and return and item on a set. Because set it unordered so we
   cannot possibly control which item will be popped.**
4. `clear()` **:-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp;This method is used to remove all elements on a set.**

```python
# remove() method
my_set = {"a", "b", "c", "d", "e"}
my_set.remove("d")
print(my_set)
# <<< {'c', 'e', 'b', 'a'}

# discard() method 
my_set.discard("d")
#  << {'c', 'b', 'a'}
print(my_set)

# pop() method
my_set.pop()
print(my_set)

# clear() method
my_set.clear()
print(my_set)
```

### ðŸŒŸ  `set` operations :-

1. **`set` union :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; A union of two sets refers to a set that contains all elements from the given sets. We
   can use `|`  operator or the union method to perform the operation. The result is a combination of all elements which
   are returned in ascending order.
    - **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
x = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
y = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}

# using union operator
print(x | y)
# <<< {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

# ---------------- This is another method to do the above task using union method
result = x.union(y)
print(result)
# <<< {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

print(y.union(x))  # this is the same result of above task
# <<< {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
```

- **`set` Intersection :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **The intersection of two sets refers to the set of common elements between them .
  It is performed with either the `&` operator or the `intersection()` method. Both returns a set with elements that are
  arranged in ascending order.**

```python
x = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
z = {3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 1}

# using intersection(&) operator
print(x & z)
# <<< {1, 3, 9, 7}

# ---------------- This is another method to do the above task using intersection method
print(x.intersection(z))
# <<< {1, 3, 9, 7}

print(z.intersection(x))  # this is the same result of above task
# <<< {1, 3, 9, 7}
```

- **`set` Difference :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **`set` Difference refers to a set of elements that are found in one set but not in
  other set.**
    - **The difference of `X` and `Y` `(X-Y)` is a set of elements that can be found in `X` but not in `Y`.**

```python
x = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9}
y = {2, 8, 9, 5, 2, 1}

# using difference(-) operator
print(x - y)
# <<< {3,7}

# ---------------- This is another method to do the above task using difference method
result = x.difference(y)
print(result)
# <<< {3, 7}

print(y.difference(x))
# <<< {8}
```

- **`set` Symmetric Difference :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **The symmetric difference between two sets refers to the set of elements
  that are not common in both sets.**
    - **It is performed with either the `^` operator or the symmetric difference method.**

```python
x = {1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8}
y = {5, 2, 6, 1, 8, 10}

# using symmetric difference(^) operator
print(x ^ y)
# << {2, 3, 4, 10}

# using symmetric_difference method 
result = x.symmetric_difference(y)
print(result)
# << {2, 3, 4, 10}
```

### ðŸŒŸ `set` object methods:-

1. `add()`
2. `update()` ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; This method add only value.**
3. `discard()` ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; This method does not raise error.**
4. `remove()`
5. `intersection()`
6. `union()`
7. `clear()`
8. `issubset()`
9. `issuperset()`
10. `pop()`

### ðŸŒŸ `set` comprehension :-

- **Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‡

```text
set_object = {expression for e in set_object } 
```

- **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
user_input = input("Enter a string: ")
s1 = {e for e in user_input if e in "aeiou"}
```

### ðŸŒŸ User input :-

```python
s = input("Enter elements separated by comma : ")
s1 = {eval(e) for e in s.split(",")}
```

## ðŸŒŸ Dictionary <span id="dict"><span>:-

- **`dict` is a class.**
- **`dict` is mutable.**
- **`dict` is not hashable.**
- **`dict` is iterable.**
- **`dict` is not a sequence.**
- **`dict` cannot have duplicate keys (not data values).**
- **indexing is not applicable to `dict` to object.**
- **slicing operator is not applicable.**
- **`dict` elements are a pair of key-value and data-value.**
- **A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs which are separated by a colon and enclosed with in curly
  braces `{}`.**

### ðŸŒŸ How to create `dict` object :-

- We can create a dictionary with the following way :-

```python
d1 = {102: "Rahul", 105: "Ganesh", 107: "Arjun", 109: "Mahesh"}

# empty dict object
d2 = {}
```

- Another way of creating dictionary is with `dict()` function that is a built function. This function allows
  programmers to create a dictionary out of a `list` of `tuple` pairs. Each pair will have two elements that can be used
  as a key and a value.
- When we use `dict` function then we will have to pass key and value pair and key is a variable name.

```python
# To create a dictionary using dict function 
d3 = dict(a=10, b=20, c=30)

# create a dictionary of list of tuples
pairs = [("cat", "kitten"), ("dog", "puppy")]
d4 = dict(pairs)
print(d4)
# <<< {'cat': 'kitten', 'dog': 'puppy'}
```

### ðŸŒŸ How To Access `dict` elements :-

- **Since a dictionary is an unordered data type so we can not use indexing to access values. We will instead use its
  keys.**
- **We can access data place the keys inside the square brackets.**
- **We can access the same value with `get()` method.**

```python
d1 = {
    102: "Mahesh",
    103: "Payal",
    104: "Ganesh",
    105: "Rahul",
    106: "Arjun"
}

# To print dictionary
print(d1)

# To access dict elements
print(d1[102], d2[103], d1[104], d1[106])
# <<< Mahesh Payal Ganesh Arjun

# To access dict elements using get method.
d1.get(102)
# <<< 'Mahesh'

# using for loop
for k in d1:
    # this will print only keys
    print(k, end=" ")

for k in d1:
    # this will print keys and values 
    print(k, d1[k], end="")
```

### ðŸŒŸ How To Edit or Add `dict` elements :-

- **We can easily add new items or modify the value of existing keys with the assignment operator `=`.**
- **When we assign a `key:value` pair to a dictionary.Python checks that the already exists on the dictionary or not. If
  there is a similar key the value simply gets updated.**
- **If it is a unique key then the `key:value` pair is added to the dictionary.**
- **Editing `dict` elements means you want to change data-value of element and not the key-value.**
- To edit new elements in the `dict`
- **Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‡
    ```text
    dictObject[key_value]= new_data_value
    ```
- To add new elements in the `dict` :-
- **Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‡
    ```text
    dictObject[new_key_value]= new_data_value
    ```
- **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
d5 = {"name": "ganesh", "age": 21, "ranking": 1}
# updating value of dictionary
d1['age'] = 22
print(d5)
# <<< {"name": "ganesh", "age": 22, "ranking": 1}
```

### ðŸŒŸ Removing or Deleting Elements from a dictionary :-

- `pop()` **:- ðŸ‘‰** **&nbsp; This method is used to remove the pair and returns the value for the given key.**
    - **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
dct = {
    "ocean": "Pacific Ocean",
    "sea": "Baltic Sea",
    "river": "Yamuna"
}
# using pop method
element = dct.pop('river')
print(element)
# <<< Yamuna

print(dct)
# <<< {'ocean': 'Pacific Ocean', 'sea': 'Baltic Sea'}

# adding new elements in a dictionary
dct['status'] = 'regular'

print(dct)
# <<< {'ocean': 'Pacific Ocean', 'sea': 'Baltic Sea', 'status': 'regular'}
``` 

- **To delete any pair of dictionary we can also use `del` keyword.**

```python
dct = {'ocean': 'Pacific Ocean', 'sea': 'Baltic Sea', 'river': 'Yamuna'}
del dct['river']
print(dct)
# <<< {'ocean': 'Pacific Ocean', 'sea': 'Baltic Sea'}
```

- `clear()`**:-**  &nbsp; ðŸ‘‰ It is used to remove all items in a dictionary.

```python
dct.clear()
print(dct)
# empty dictionary 
# <<< { } 
```

- `popitem()` :- ðŸ‘‰ This method takes no argument and remove an arbitrary pair from the dictionary. It is also return a
  `tuple` of keys and values that is removed.
    - Using `popitem` method we could no control over the value it will remove.

```python
dct = {
    "ocean": "Pacific Ocean",
    "sea": "Baltic Sea",
    "river": "Danube"
}
dct.popitem()
```

### ðŸŒŸ Concatenation And Repetition Operator :-

1. `dict` + `dict` ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **not supported**
2. `dict` * `int` &nbsp; ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **not supported**

### ðŸŒŸ Comparison Operator :-

1. `d1 > d2` &nbsp; ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp;  **not supported**
2. `d1 >= d2` ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **not supported**
3. `d1 < d2` &nbsp; ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **not supported**
4. `d1 <= d2` ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **not supported**
5. `d1 == d2` ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **supported**
6. `d1 != d2` ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **supported**

- **Two `dict` objects are equal if their items are equal Elements can be stored in any order.**

### ðŸŒŸ Other Python Dictionary Methods :-

1. `items()` :- ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **This method returns list of dictionary keys-value pairs.**
    - **Syntax:-** ðŸ‘‡
        - `dict.items()`
2. `values()` :- ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **This method returns a list of dictionary values.**
    - **Syntax:-** ðŸ‘‡
        - `dict.values()`
3. `keys()` :- ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **This method returns a list of dictionary keys.**
    - **Syntax:-** ðŸ‘‡
        - `dict.keys()`

```python
dct = {"name": "Rocky", "age": 21, "rank": 2}

# this method returns all dictionary values.
print(dct.values())
# <<< dict_values(['Rocky', 21, 2])

# this method returns all dictionary keys.
print(dct.keys())
# <<< dict_keys(['name', 'age', 'rank'])

# this method returns all dictionary key-value pairs
print(dct.items())
# <<< dict_items([('name', 'Rocky'), ('age', 21), ('rank', 2)])
```

4. `setdefault()` :- ðŸ‘‰ This method searches for a given key in a dictionary and returns the value if found.
    - **Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‡
    ```text
    dict_object.setdefault(key_name,Default_value=None)
    ```
5. **`copy()` :-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; This method returns a copy of dictionary.It allows us to modify the dictionary copy
   without altering the original file.**
    - **If we don't copy the dictionary then everything that we will be change in copied variable that will be also
      apply on original dictionary element.**
    - **To get rid of this we will have to use `copy()` method of `dict` class.**

```python
student_dct = {"name": "ganesh", "age": 22, "gender": "Male"}
# put dictionary in a variable named dct
dct = student_dct
dct["name"] = "Mahesh"
print(dct)
# <<< {'name': 'Mahesh', 'age': 22, 'gender': 'Male'}
print(student_dct)
# <<< {'name': 'Mahesh', 'age': 22, 'gender': 'Male'}
```

6. **`fromkeys()`:-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; This method takes a sequence of items and uses them as keys to create a new dictionary.
   It allows a second argument through which you can provide a value that will be attached to the keys on the new
   dictionary.**
    - **Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‡
    - `dct_object.fromkeys(iterable,value)`

```python
appliance = ["monitor", "mouse", "keyboard", "speaker"]
# create an empty dictionary
dct = {}
new_dct = dct.fromkeys(appliance, 10)
print(new_dct)
# <<< {'monitor': 10, 'mouse': 10, 'keyboard': 10, 'speaker': 10}
```

7. **`update()` :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **This method is used to add new key-value in the existing dictionary.**

```python
course_dct = {"name": "Python", "fees": 8000, "duration": "2 months"}
course_dct.update({"fees": 10000})
print(course_dct)
# <<< {'name': 'Python', 'fees': 10000, 'duration': '2 months'}

# We can also do the above task like the following way :-
course_dct["fees"] = 10000
print(course_dct)
# <<< {'name': 'Python', 'fees': 10000, 'duration': '2 months'}
```

### ðŸŒŸ Dictionary Comprehension :-

- I**t is a concise way of creating a new dictionary from a python iterable.. It consists of key-value expression and a
  for statement enclosed in curly braces `{ }`.**

```python
number_square = {x: x ** 2 for x in range(10)}
print(number_square)
# <<< {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64, 9: 81}

even_number_square = {x: x ** 2 for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0}
print(even_number_square)
# <<< {2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36, 8: 64, 10: 100}
```
