# Python :-

- Python is a high level general purpose programming language. It's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with
  the use of significant indentation.
- **Python is dynamically type-checked and garbage-collected.** It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
  structured (particularly procedural), **object-oriented** and **functional programming**. It is often described as a
  **"batteries included"** language due to its comprehensive standard library.

## History Of Python :-

- Python was conceived in the late 1980s by **[Guido Van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum)** at
  **Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica** in the Netherlands as a successor of the **ABC Language**.
- He has been in variably worked as the lead developer until 12 July 2018.
- In January 2019 active Python core developer elected a five member council to lead the Project.

### ðŸŒŸ Variable :-

- Variable are used to hold data during execution of the programme.
- In C , C++ you need to declare variables only after declaration you can use them.
- Example :-
  ```text
  int a;
  float b;
  ```
- In Python, you do not declare variable. If there is a need of a variable you think of a name nd start using it is a
  variable.

#### ðŸŒŸ Variable Name :-

- **Variable name is any combination of alphabet,digit and underscore.**
- **Variable name can not start with digit.**
- **Variable name are case-sensitive.**
- **Keywords can not be uses as variable names.**
- **Variable can be deleted also using** `del` **keyword.**

#### ðŸŒŸ Dynamic Type :-

- Not only the value of a variable may change during programme execution but type as well.
    - For example :- ðŸ‘‡

      ```python
      marks = 5                   # type of x is int.
      salary = 50000.725          # type of x is float.
      isNumber = True             # type of x is bool.
      user_name = "Iron Man"      # type of x is str.
      ```
- All Data types are class in Python.

#### ðŸŒŸ Data Types :-

1. Numbers :-
   --- Here display table
2. Boolean
3. String

- `double` is no there in Python.
- `char`  is not there in Python.
- _----- Here show picture.

#### ðŸŒŸ Name kiska hota hai:-

- Name in namespace is a variable which is used to contain id(reference) of
    1. Instance object
    2. Function object
    3. Class object

    - ðŸŒŸ  **&nbsp; In Python everything is object.**

### ðŸŒŸ What is an object :-

- Object is something which can store data and has methods(function) to handle data.
- **e.g. :-** ðŸ‘‡
  ```python
  a, b, c = 5, 6, 7
  print(a, b, c, sep="-", end="$")
  print("Hello")
  # <<< 5-6-7$Hello
  ```

-----

### Data :-

- Data is any piece of information which is used by the programme to accomplish(complete) a task.
- **e.g. :-** ðŸ‘‡

    1. Find sum of two numbers.
    2. check whether a given number is even or odd.
    3. Find LCM of two numbers.

- All the above tasks can be done only using some data.

#### ðŸŒŸ Variety of Data :-

1. Integers
2. Real (Float)
3. Strings

#### ðŸŒŸ Garbage Collection :-

- It is a programme invoked(called) by Python itself whenever required whose job is to release memory of Garbage
  blocks.(Object which is not referenced by any name/variable.)

#### ðŸŒŸ What is an Object :-

- Object is real entity.
- Object is an instance of a class.
- Object is a proper noun.
- Class is a common noun.
- **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

    - Doctor ----> Common Noun (class)
    - Dr. Mak ----> Proper Noun (object)
    - Dr. Alok ----> Proper Noun (object)

#### ðŸŒŸ `print()` function :-

**Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None, flush=False)
```

- print simple text ---->  `print("Welcome")`
- print variable ----> `print(x)`
- print expression ----> `print(x + 5*3)`
- print multiple value ----> `print(x , y)`

-----

### ðŸŒŸ Module Package & Library :-

- **Module :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **It is a Python file. It can contain instance objects , function objects and class objects. In
  Simple words it contains variables functions and classes.**
    - **`.py` file is known as Module.**
- **Package :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **Package is a collection of module and sub-packages.**
- **Library :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **Library is a collection of packages.**

-----

### ðŸŒŸ `import` :-

  ```text
  import moduleName
  
  moduleName.moduleElement
  ```

- **Module element can be :- ðŸ‘‡**
    - `variable`
    - `function`
    - `class`
- If we want to import specific object form any module then we will write
  ```python
  from A2 import  x
  ```
- Where :-
    - A2 ðŸ‘‰ **Module Name**
    - x ðŸ‘‰  **module element**

### ðŸŒŸ Keywords :-

- Predefined words
- Reserved words
- There are 35 keywords in `Python` .

|        |          |           |        |
|:------:|:--------:|:---------:|:------:|
| False  |  class   |   from    |   or   |
|  True  | continue |  global   |  pass  |
|  None  |   def    |    if     | raise  |
|  and   |   del    |  import   | return |
|   as   |   elif   |    in     |  try   |
| assert |   else   |    is     | while  |
| async  |  except  |  lambda   |  with  |

```python
x = 25
bin(x)
# <<<< '0b11001'
oct(x)
# <<<< '0o31'
hex(x)
# <<<< '0x19'

#  x = 0b11001 (in binary)
#  x = 0o31    (in octal)
#  x = 0x19    (in hexadecimal)
```

### ðŸŒŸ Unicode :-

- **The Unicode is character encoding and its goal is to replace like existing character sets with its standard UTF.**

    - UTF ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; Unicode Transformation Format**
    - UTF-8 ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; It is the most commonly used character encoding. It is also backward compatible with ASCII.**

### ðŸŒŸ Character To Unicode :-

```python
x = "A"
ord(x)
# <<<< 65
```

### ðŸŒŸ Unicode To Character  :-

```python
x = 65
chr(x)
# <<<< 'A'
```

### ðŸŒŸ Taking input from the User `input()`:-

- `input()` can take at most one argument of `str` type.
- `input()` always return `str` type value.

-----

### ðŸŒŸ Operators :-

----- 

## ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ List :-

- **`list` is a class.**
- **`list` is an iterable sequence.**
- **`list` is growable.**
- **`list` can store heterogeneous data.**
- **`list` elements are indexed.**
- ***List* is one fo the most commonly used sequences, and it is a most flexible type basically a list can contain any
  type (string, float, integer etc.) and number of items. It can hold one data type or a combination of several data
  types .**
- **A List is mutable(changeable) hence you can add, delete modify elements. We can build a list by assigning to it
  using the following syntax :-**
- **Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‡
  ```text
  lst_items = [ item1, item2, item3,.......]
  ```

**Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
lst = [0, 5, 10, "Hello", "Python"]
```

### How to create list object :-

```python
# Square brackets are used to denote a list.
l1 = [10, 20, 30]

# Empty list object
l2 = []

# Heterogeneous elements
l3 = [50, 35, "abc", "Python", "JavaScript"]
```

### ðŸŒŸ How to access list elements :-

```python
l1 = [50, 20, 80, 30, 60, 40]
print(l1)
# <<< [50, 20, 80, 30, 60, 40]

print(l1[0])
# <<< 50

print(l1[1], l1[2])
# <<< 20 80

# Create a list of first 4 numbers
num_list = list(range(4))
print(num_list)
# <<< [0, 1, 2, 3]
```

- I have to insert Here image of list indexing

#### ðŸŒŸ Indexing :-

- **Just like strings we can access items on a list with the `index operator[]`.**
- **Always use an integer when indexing to avoid `TypeError`. Attempting to access a list element that is beyond the
  index range will result to and `IndexError.`**

##### ðŸŒŸ **Nested Indexing :-**

  ```python
lst_elements = [5, 6, 10, 15, "code", [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]]
print(lst_elements[5][1])
# <<< 3
print(lst_elements[4][0])
# <<< c
   ```

###### ðŸŒŸ **Negative Indexing :-**

- The last item on the list takes the -1 index the second to the last has the -2 index and so on.

```python
num_lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
print(num_lst[-1])  # same as it is ---> print(num_lst[len(num_lst)-1]) 
# <<< 80
print(num_lst[-2])  # same as it is ---> print(num_lst[len(num_lst)-2]) 
# <<< 70
```

##### ðŸŒŸ **Slicing of List :-**

- The slicing operator the `colon(:)` is used to access a range of elements on lists.

- **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
char_list = ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o", "W", "o", "r", "l", "d"]
print(char_list[0:5])
# ["H","e","l","l","o"]
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Accessing list elements via `for` loop :-

```python
num_lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]

for num in num_lst:
    print(num, end=" ")
```

##### ðŸŒŸ Accessing list elements via `while` loop :-

```python
num_lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]

i = 0
while i < len(num_lst):
    print(num_lst[i], end="")
    i += 1
```

##### ðŸŒŸ How to delete an element from the list:-

```python
num_lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
del num_lst[4]
```

##### ðŸŒŸ How to edit an element of the list:-

```python
num_lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80]
num_lst[4] = 100

# <<< [10, 20, 30, 40, 100, 60, 70, 80]
```

#### How to add more elements in the list :-

```python
num_lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
num_lst[6] = 60  # Index error

# not adding more values in the list but only updating values at index 3 & 1
num_lst[3] = 800
num_lst[1] = 600
```

- There are the following methods to add elements in the list:-

1. `append()`
2. `extend()`
3. `insert()`

- `class` is a group of variables and functions. These variables and functions are called attributes.

##### ðŸŒŸ Syntax :- ðŸ‘‡

```text
listObject.append(value)

listObject.extend(iterable)

listObject.insert(index,value)
```

- `append()` method adds value at the end of the list that is new element will become the last element of the list.
- `extend()` method extends the list by appending all the items from the iterable.
    - `extend()` method takes exactly one argument(maximum) and that argument should be iterable.
    - `extend()` method append(add) only iterable value not iterable type.
- `insert(index,value)` method insert an item at a given position.
    - if `index > last_index` then value will store at `last_index +1` means value will be appended.

#### ðŸŒŸ Example :- ðŸ‘‡

```python
num_lst = [10, 20, 30]

num_lst.append(40)
print(num_lst)
# <<< [10,20,30,40]

num_lst.insert(1, 200)
print(num_lst)
# <<< [10,200,30,40]

# if index > last_index then 
num_lst.insert(10, 10000)
print(num_lst)
# <<< [10,20,30,40,1000]

num_lst.extend([60, 70, 80, 90])
print(num_lst)
# <<<< [10,20,30,40,1000,60,70,80,90]

lst = [1, 3, 5]
lst.extend(range(6))

# this will give error because extend takes exactly one argument here two is given
# lst.extend([1,2,4,5],[7,8,9])  
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Packing And Unpacking :-

```python
a, b, c = 10, 20, 30
lst = [a, b, c]  # packing

num_lst = [40, 50, 60]
a, b, c = num_lst  # unpacking
```

- ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ **When we unpack of any sequence then, number of variables on the left hand side must be same as the number of
  elements in the list.**
- ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ **If we don't know how many elements are there in the `list/tuple/set` then we will have to assign at least one
  variable and after this variable we will have to use asterisk sign and name of the variable.**

```python
lst = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70]
a, *b = lst

print(a)
# <<< 10
print(b)  # type of b is list 
# <<< [20,30,40,50,60,70]
```

### ðŸŒŸ Built-in methods :-

1. `len()` ðŸ‘‰ Returns length of specified iterable.
2. `min()` ðŸ‘‰ Returns minimum value element.
3. `max()` ðŸ‘‰ Returns maximum value element.
4. `sum()` ðŸ‘‰ Returns sum of elements.
5. `sorted()` ðŸ‘‰ Returns sorted new list of elements (it's not change original list).

#### ðŸŒŸ `list()` method :-

- `list()` method takes at most(maximum) one argument that argument should be iterable.

```python
# create an empty list object.
lst = list()

# this will gives error because int object is not iterable.
# lst1=list(10)  

# this will gives error because list() method takes maximum one argument here 3 is given.
# lst2=list(10,20,30)

lst3 = list("Captain America")
# <<< ['C', 'a', 'p', 't', 'a', 'i', 'n', ' ', 'A', 'm', 'e', 'r', 'i', 'c', 'a']

lst4 = list(range(5))
# <<< [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

lst5 = list([10, 20])
# <<< [10,20]
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Comparison Operator on `list` :-

```python
l1 = [1, 2, 3]
l2 = [2, 3, 1]
l3 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
l4 = [1, 2, 3]
```

- If we compare two `list` then give the following results :-
- `l1 == l2` ðŸ‘‰ `False`
- `l1 == l3` ðŸ‘‰ `False`
- `l1 == l4` ðŸ‘‰ `True`
- `l1 > l4`  ðŸ‘‰ `True`

#### ðŸŒŸ Concatenation Operator :-

```python
lst1 = [1, 5, 9]
lst2 = [2, 3, 1]

result = lst1 + lst2

print(result)
# <<< [1, 5, 9, 2, 3, 1]
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Repetition Operator :-

```python
l1 = [2, 5]
print(l1 * 5)
# <<< [2, 5, 2, 5, 2, 5]
```

#### ðŸŒŸ list of lists :-

```python
lst = [[1, 3, 5], [2, 1, 8], [5, 4, 4]]
```

#### ðŸŒŸ `list` object methods :-

<p align="center"> ðŸŒŸ <strong>Adding elements to a list :-</strong></p>

1. `append()` :- ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **It is used to add a single item at the end of the original list. It works with element data
   type not a value. It is change the original `list` object.**
    ```text
    list_object.append(object)
    ```
2. `extend()` :- ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **It is used to add two or more items at the end of the original list. It works only on
   element value not data type.**
    ```text
    list_object.extend(iterable)
    ```
3. `insert()` :- This method is used to insert an item on your desired location.
    ```text
    list_object.insert(index_number, value)
    ```

- **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
even_number = [2, 4, 6, 8]
even_number.append(10)
print(even_number)
# <<< [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

num_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]
num_list.extend([101, 501, 511])
print(num_list)
# <<< [10, 20, 30, 40, 101, 501, 511]

odd_number = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
odd_number.insert(2, 55)
print(odd_number)
# <<< [1, 3, 55, 7, 9]
```

<p align="center"> ðŸŒŸ <strong>Removing or Deleting elements from a list :-</strong></p>

- There are four methods to remove items from the list :-

1. **`remove()` :-** ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; To remove an item from a list we can use remove method. It does not return anything.**
    ```text
    list_object.remove(value)
    ```

2. `pop()` :- ðŸ‘‰ **&nbsp; It is used to remove the item associated with the given index. If the index is not given By
   default It removes last element and returns that element. It is returned that value that is removed from the `list`.
   **
    ```text
    list_object.pop(index_value)
    ```
3. `clear()` :- **It is used to create an empty `list`.**
    ```text
    list_object.clear()
    ```
4. `del` **keyword :-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; It is used to delete one or more items or event the entire list.
    - **To delete one item from the list is , Syntax is :-** <br />
      ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; `del list_object[index_value]`
    - **To delete range of item from the list is , Syntax is :-** <br />
      ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; `del list_object[:]`
    - **We can delete the entire items from the list by the replacing the entire range of items with an empty space.**
        - **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
numbers_list[:] = []
print(numbers_list)
# <<< []
``` 

#### ðŸŒŸ Example :-

```python
numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, "Hello", 7]
numbers_list.remove("Hello")
print(numbers_list)
# <<< [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

color_list = ["red", "yellow", "blue", "green", "pink", "brown", "white"]

# It removes the third index element from the list.
color_list.pop(3)

# It removes last item (By default).
color_list.pop()

color_list.clear()
print(color_list)
# <<< []
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Sorting Items on a `list` :-

- `sort()` **:-** ðŸ‘‰ &nbsp; **This method is used to sort items of similar data type with in the list. It sorts the items
  in ascending order (By default). It changes original `list`.**
- **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
number_list = [15, 13, 12, 16, 11, 14]
number_list.sort()
print(number_list)
# <<< [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
```

#### ðŸŒŸ Reverse method :-

- **This method is used to arrange items in the reverse or descending order. It changes original `list` also.**
- **Syntax :-** ðŸ‘‡

```text
list_object.sort(key=None, reverse=False)
```

- **Example :-** ðŸ‘‡

```python
number_list = [15, 13, 12, 16, 11, 14]
# sort in ascending order (By default)
number_list.reverse()
print(number_list)
# <<< [16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11]

# sort in descending order
number_list.sort(reverse=True)
```

#### ðŸŒŸ `count()` method :-

- The `count()` method counts how many times an object occurs in a list.
    ```text
    list_object.count(object)
    ```

#### ðŸŒŸ `index()` method :-

- `index()` method returns of first occurrence of specifies element.

- `copy()` method Return a shallow copy of the list.

#### ðŸŒŸ Testing For Membership in the `list` :-

- **Membership operators are used to test if an object is stored in a list. It returns True Oor False after evaluating
  the
  expression.**

```python
numbers_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
print(9 in numbers_list)
# <<< True

print(15 not in numbers_list)
## True
```

### ðŸŒŸ `list` Comprehension :-
